This is a simplified gml/dot graph viewer programmed in native windows gui interface.
Then this windows version gml4win.exe does not need 28 Mbytes GTK-3 dll's to run it.
It is compiled on Linux using gcc mingw 64bits compiler and tested using wine64 on Linux.
This has minimal gui features compared to the GTK+ Linux gui version gml4gtk but is usable.
For more graph features there is gml4gtk windows version at https://gml4gtk.sourceforge.io
The gml4win.exe does not need extra dll's or configuration files and does not create files.
To install gml4win.exe copy the program gml4win.exe to any directory folder of own choice.
Only the program gml4win.exe is needed and the other files are example graph data and src.
To un-install gml4win.exe delete the file.
