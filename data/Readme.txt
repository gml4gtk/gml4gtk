This archive contains the collection of artificial graphs
with known crossing numbers
gml/		contains the graphs in GML file format
Each directory contains subdirectories for the different kinds
of graphs:
Cm_x_Cn	cross products of cycles
Gi_x_Cn	cross products of 5-vertex graphs with cycles
Gi_x_Pn	cross products of 5-vertex graphs with paths
P(n,2)	generalized Petersen graphs
P(n,3)	generalized Petersen graphs

Each file name reflects the graph itself and its crossing number (_cnXX).
